# React Pomodoro Timer

[this project can be viewed here](https://njmyers.github.io/react-metronome/)

I created this project as part of my process for trying to learn the react framework. I borrowed the frame concept from one of my earlier projects [react metronome](https://github.com/njmyers/react-metronome). This makes for accurate timekeeping and animations as they are both based off of the same clock. 

Click through to the [metronome](https://njmyers.github.io/react-metronome/) for a detailed technical explanation of the timekeeping and animation process.
